## Project Overview

With the rise of generative AI, distinguishing between human-created and AI-generated images has become a crucial challenge. Deepfake detection is essential for maintaining media integrity, preventing misinformation, and ensuring security. This project involves training a machine learning model to classify images as either AI-generated or human-created using deep learning techniques.   

This project was submitted as part of the Kaggle AI vs Human-Generated Images Competition, where models were evaluated based on the F1-score at a 0.5 threshold.   

#### Competition Rank: 283/554   
#### F1-Score: 0.63359   

## Dataset   

The dataset consists of 79,950 training images and 19,986 test images, with labels indicating whether an image is AI-generated (1) or human-created (0).   

## Files:   

train.csv - Training set with image IDs and labels.   

test.csv - Test set with image IDs (labels are to be predicted).  

train_data/ - Folder containing training images.   

test_data/ - Folder containing test images.   


## Approach & Model   

### 1. Data Preparation:   

Split data into train and validation sets.   

Defined data augmentation techniques for training images.   

Created a custom dataset class for PyTorch.   



### 2. Model Selection & Training:   

Used EfficientNet-B3 as the base model (without pretrained weights).   

Set up train transforms and validation/test transforms for image preprocessing.   

Stopped training at Epoch 4 due to CPU limitations (initial plan: 12 epochs).   




## Future Improvements   

ðŸš€ Train on GPU to allow for more epochs (20+ for better generalization).   
ðŸš€ Experiment with pretrained models to enhance performance.   
ðŸš€ Fine-tune hyperparameters to improve the F1-score.   

## Technologies Used   

Deep Learning Frameworks: PyTorch, Torchvision   

Model: EfficientNet-B3   

Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy   

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
